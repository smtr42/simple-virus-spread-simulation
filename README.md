During the Covid-19 outbreak I saw a very nice article from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) explaining how a virus spread among people. It includes nice embedded visuals made by [Harry Stevens](https://twitter.com/Harry_Stevens).
I wanted, as a personal challenge and as an aspiring programmer, to write a similar simple program but in python 3.

The collision algorithm was heavily inspired (copied) from [Peter Collingridge](https://github.com/petercollingridge) python 2 physics simulation and his very nice [tutorial](http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/pygame-physics-simulation/).
### State
It's a simple simulation. There is yet no chart implementation.

The algorithm is quite expensive, so above a few hundred particles the simulation is not usable.

It's a quick side project, optimisation, PEP compliance, documentation and general code readability will be worked in the future.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
I used Python 3.7.
I use pipenv to manage dependencies.

#### Pipenv
- Clone the repo
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/smtr42/spread.git
```
- Install required dependencies
```shell script
pipenv install
```
#### Virtual env
- Create a virtual environment
```shell script
python3 -m venv env
```
- Install requirements
```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open a Command Line Interface and launch the main.py script with Python.
```shell script
python -m main
```
