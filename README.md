During the Covid-19 outbreak I saw a very nice article from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) explaining how a virus spread among people. It contained nice embedded visuals.
I wanted, as a personal challenge and as an aspiring programmer, to write a similar program but in python 3.

It was heavily inspired from [Peter Collingridge](https://github.com/petercollingridge) physics simulation.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
I used Python 3.7.
I use pipenv to manage dependencies.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/smtr42/spread.git
```
2. Install required dependencies
```sh
pipenv install
```
### Launch simulation


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Open a Command Line Interface and launch the main.py script with Python.
```shell script
python -m main
```
### Specifications

When prompted, answer the question by typing the appropriate number or letter.
For a first start you must download data from the API and reset the database. 
Here is an example of usage :
* Type "y" to donwload data
* Type "y" to reset the database
* Type "1" to search for food to substitute
* Select a category
* Select food
* Select healthy food
* You can either go back or save the food in the database for later use.
<br>

All along you can write "r" for going back, "q" to quit, "m" to go back to the first menu.
